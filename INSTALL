Installing sakura
===============

* How to compile and install this beast ?

	$ ./0 
	$ make
	$ su -c 'make install'

	sakura use the MOBS building system. That means you need to run the "0"
	script instead of a "configure" script, but the syntax is very similar.

	In this example, the 0 script is executed without any parameters, so sakura
	gets installed in the default directory (/usr/local), but you can
	tell to 0 your favourite installation directories, in an syntax very 
	similar to 'configure'. For example, to change the prefix installation
	directory and the data directory, run 0 with the command './0 --prefix=/usr'
	For all the installation options run './0 --help'.

Enjoy sakura !

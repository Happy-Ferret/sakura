# Sakura fork

This is a [Sakura](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~dabisu/sakura/sakura/files) fork with following features:
* builds on Ubuntu 14.04
* separator as first item of right click popup menu (to avoid annoying new tab opened)
* do not change window title if it was set by user

I have backported most code commits from upstream (except translations and background feature) and plan to backport at least new bugfixes/stabilization commits.

You can find my copy of upstream in the [master branch](https://github.com/gdm85/sakura/tree/master).

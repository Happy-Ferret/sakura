# Sakura fork

This is a [Sakura](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~dabisu/sakura/sakura/files) fork with following features:
* builds on Ubuntu 14.04 (see `trusty` branch)
* separator as first item of the right click popup menu (to avoid annoying new tab opened)
* do not change window title if it was set by user
* swap 'Fullscreen' and 'Set window title' from 1st and 2nd menu levels

You can find an upstream mirror in the [master branch](https://github.com/gdm85/sakura/tree/master).
